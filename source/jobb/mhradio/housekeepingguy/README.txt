;;; Installation ;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Installation of this is really simple. 

1. Upload the staff folder to your web hosting account. You can rename this to anything you like at any time.
2. CHMOD config.php and the radio_config.php file to 777.
3. Now simply go to http://yourdomain.com/staff/install.php and follow the instructions!

If you need any help, let me (Guy Riese) know and if I'm available then I'll help you.

;;; Login ;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Now all you need to do is login, the user that was added when you ran the SQL is:

Username: Admin
Password: changeme

Login URL: yourdomain.com/staff

Have fun!

So the DJ Panel is pretty straight forward, now you'll want to put some pages on your website. So here are some links.

Request Line - /staff/request.php - can be linked to for visitors to send requests.
Timetable - /staff/showtimetable.php - can be linked to for visitors to view timetable.
DJ Says (and alert system) - /staff/says.php - can be put in an iframe in a box on a page.
Automatic DJ List - /staff/stafflist.php - can be put in an iframe or "php include"'d on a staff page
DJ Applications - /staff/djapplication.php - can be linked to for visitors to send a DJ Application.
